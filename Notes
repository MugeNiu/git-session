#Github- committing
git checkout paste id
to go back to the current version: git checkout master
git stash:made changes in my file, want to go to the last stable commit, apply git stash 
	takes you back to the last stable commit 
git log:tells you what commits have been made
git commit -am is the same as git commit add . 

An even more powerful tool is to create new branches:
git checkout -b new-feature: check out a new branch, name can't have spaces
switch back and forth anytime by doing git checkout master
	am: add and have a message 
git checkout master
git merge new-feature 
(the plus and minus are numbers of lines modified, added or removed)
git log: tells you all the commits 

Github is a complete different
